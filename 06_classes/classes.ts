// ==========================
// Public, private, and protected modifiers
// ==========================

// *** Public by default ***

// In TypeScript, each member is public by default.
// You may still mark a member public explicitly.

class Animal2 {
  public name: string;

  public constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public move(distanceInMeters: number) {
    console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
  }
}

// *** ECMAScript Private Fields ***

class Animal3 {
  #name: string; // private variable

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
}

// new Animal3("Cat").#name;
// Property '#name' is not accessible outside class 'Animal3' because it has a private identifier.

// *** Understanding TypeScript’s private ***

// TypeScript also has its own way to declare a member as being marked private, it cannot
// be accessed from outside of its containing class.

class Animal4 {
  private name;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

// new Animal4("james").name;
// Property 'name' is private and only accessible within class 'Animal4'.

// TypeScript is a structural type system. When we compare two different types, regardless of where
// they came from, if the types of all members are compatible, then we say the types themselves
// are compatible.

// However, when comparing types that have private and protected members, we treat these
// types differently. For two types to be considered compatible, if one of them has a
// private member, then the other must have a private member that originated in the same
// declaration. The same applies to protected members.

class Animal5 {
  private name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Rhino extends Animal5 {
  constructor() {
    super("Rhino");
  }
}

class Employee1 {
  private name: string;

  constructor(theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
}

let animal = new Animal5("GOAT");
let rhino = new Rhino();
let employee1 = new Employee1("Bob");

animal = rhino;
// animal = employee1; // error
// Type 'Employee1' is not assignable to type 'Animal'.
//    Types have separate declarations of a private property 'name'.

// In this example, we have an Animal and a Rhino, with Rhino being a subclass of
// Animal. We also have a new class Employee that looks identical to Animal in
// terms of shape. We create some instances of these classes and then try to assign
// them to each other to see what will happen. Because Animal and Rhino share the
// private side of their shape from the same declaration of private name: string
// in Animal, they are compatible. However, this is not the case for Employee.
// When we try to assign from an Employee to Animal we get an error that these
// types are not compatible. Even though Employee also has a private member called
// name, it’s not the one we declared in Animal.

// *** Understanding protected ***

// The protected modifier acts much like the private modifier with the exception that
//  members declared protected can also be accessed within deriving classes.

class Person {
  protected name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Employee2 extends Person {
  private department: string;

  constructor(name: string, department: string) {
    super(name);
    this.department = department;
  }

  public getElevatorPitch() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;
  }
}

let howard = new Employee2("Howard", "Sales");
console.log(howard.getElevatorPitch());
// console.log(howard.name); // error
// Property 'name' is protected and only accessible within class 'Person' and its subclasses.

// Notice that while we can’t use name from outside of Person, we can still use it from
// within an instance method of Employee because Employee derives from Person.

// A constructor may also be marked protected. This means that the class cannot be instantiated
// outside of its containing class, but can be extended.

class Person2 {
  protected name: string;
  protected constructor(theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
}

// Employee3 can extend Person2
class Employee3 extends Person2 {
  private department: string;

  constructor(name: string, department: string) {
    super(name);
    this.department = department;
  }

  public getElevatorPitch() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;
  }
}

let howard2 = new Employee3("Howard", "Sales");
// let john = new Person2("John");
// Constructor of class 'Person2' is protected and only accessible within the class declaration.

// *** Readonly modifier ***

// You can make properties readonly by using the readonly keyword.
// Readonly properties must be initialized at their declaration or in the constructor.

class Octopus1 {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;

  constructor(theName: string) {
    this.name = theName;
  }
}
let dad = new Octopus1("Man with the 8 strong legs");
// dad.name = "Man with the 3-piece suit"; // error

// Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.

// *** Parameter properties ***

// In our last example, we had to declare a readonly member name and a
// constructor parameter theName in the Octopus1 class.
// This is needed in order to have the value of theName accessible after
// the Octopus1 constructor is executed.

// Parameter properties let you create and initialize a member in one place.

class Octopus2 {
  readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;
  constructor(readonly name: string) {}
}

let dad2 = new Octopus2("Man with the 8 strong legs");
dad2.name;

// Notice how we dropped theName altogether and just use the shortened readonly
// name: string parameter on the constructor to create and initialize the name member.
//  We’ve consolidated the declarations and assignment into one location.

// Parameter properties are declared by prefixing a constructor parameter with an
// accessibility modifier or readonly, or both. Using private for a parameter property
// declares and initializes a private member; likewise, the same is done for public,
// protected, and readonly.

// *** Accessors ***

// TypeScript supports getters/setters as a way of intercepting accesses to a member
// of an object.

class Employee4 {
  fullName: string;
}

let employee = new Employee4();
employee.fullName = "Bob Smith";

if (employee.fullName) {
  console.log(employee.fullName);
}

// we add a setter that checks the length of the newName to make sure it’s compatible
// with the max-length of our backing database field. If it isn’t we throw an error
// notifying client code that something went wrong.

const fullNameMaxLength = 10;

class Employee5 {
  private _fullName = "";

  get fullName(): string {
    return this._fullName;
  }

  set fullName(newName: string) {
    if (newName && newName.length > fullNameMaxLength) {
      throw new Error("fullName has a max length of " + fullNameMaxLength);
    }
    this._fullName = newName;
  }
}

let employee2 = new Employee5();
employee2.fullName = "Bob Smith";

if (employee2.fullName) {
  console.log(employee2.fullName);
}

// A couple of things to note about accessors:

// First, accessors require you to set the compiler to output ECMAScript 5 or higher.
// Downleveling to ECMAScript 3 is not supported. Second, accessors with a get and no
// set are automatically inferred to be readonly. This is helpful when generating a .d.ts
// file from your code, because users of your property can see that they can’t change it.

// *** Static Properties ***

class Grid {
  static origin = { x: 0, y: 0 };

  calculateDistanceFromOrigin(point: { x: number; y: number }) {
    let xDist = point.x - Grid.origin.x;
    let yDist = point.y - Grid.origin.y;
    return Math.sqrt(xDist * xDist + yDist * yDist) / this.scale;
  }

  constructor(public scale: number) {}
}

let grid1 = new Grid(1.0); // 1x scale
let grid2 = new Grid(5.0); // 5x scale

console.log(grid1.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({ x: 10, y: 10 }));
console.log(grid2.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({ x: 10, y: 10 }));

// *** Abstract Classes ***

// Abstract classes are base classes from which other classes may be derived.
// They may not be instantiated directly.
// Unlike an interface, an abstract class may contain implementation details for its members.

abstract class Animal6 {
  abstract makeSound(): void;

  move(): void {
    console.log("roaming the earth...");
  }
}

// Methods within an abstract class that are marked as abstract do not contain an
// implementation and must be implemented in derived classes.

// Both define the signature of a method without including a method body.
// However, abstract methods must include the abstract keyword and may optionally
// include access modifiers.

abstract class Department {
  constructor(public name: string) {}

  printName(): void {
    console.log("Department name: " + this.name);
  }

  abstract printMeeting(): void; // must be implemented in derived classes
}

class AccountingDepartment extends Department {
  constructor() {
    super("Accounting and Auditing"); // constructors in derived classes must call super()
  }

  printMeeting(): void {
    console.log("The Accounting Department meets each Monday at 10am.");
  }

  generateReports(): void {
    console.log("Generating accounting reports...");
  }
}

let department: Department; // ok to create a reference to an abstract type
// department = new Department(); // error: cannot create an instance of an abstract class

department = new AccountingDepartment(); // ok to create and assign a non-abstract subclass
department.printName();
department.printMeeting();
// department.generateReports(); // error
// Property 'generateReports' does not exist on type 'Department'.

// ==========================
// Using a class as an interface
// ==========================

class Point {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

interface Point3d extends Point {
  z: number;
}

let point3d: Point3d = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 };
